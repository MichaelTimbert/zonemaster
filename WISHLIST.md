WishList for Version 2.0
=========================

1.  Multiple points of checking - Should be able to run tests from different end points and get the results and fusion together into one result
7.  Structured output of the result and/or a library to run the tool
    from another program (the library may be useful even if the tool has a
    structured output).
9.  Developing a Mobile app
10. Parallel tests
11. It would be nice to test if unknown RR types can be queried (Ref :
    https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/?36909)
