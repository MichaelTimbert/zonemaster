# Basic Test Plan

These are tests of a domain's most basic functionality. If these fail,
it will be hard or impossible to perform any other tests at all. The
test code should be constructed so that these tests are always run, even
if a subset of tests is asked for that would not normally include them.

This document uses the terminology defined in the [Master Test Plan].
