The purpose of the Zonemaster project is to develop a DNS validation software.
There are three ways one can use the Zonemaster software:

   * Using the Web user Interface: In this case, there is no installation of
     the Zonemaster software needed. A user types the URL
     [https://zonemaster.net][zonemaster.net], provides as input a domain name,
     and then can view the results.
   * From the Command Line Interface (CLI): In this case, the user has to
     install two components of the Zonemaster software, i.e. the
     [Zonemaster-Engine] and the [Zonemaster-CLI].
   * There are cases, wherein an organisation or a user, that wants to have the
     results of their DNS validation stored and can be viewed later. In that
     case, in addition to the Zonemaster-Engine and Zonemaster-CLI, the user
     has to install the [Zonemaster-Backend] and the [Zonemaster-GUI].
