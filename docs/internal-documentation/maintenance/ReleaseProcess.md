Release process
===============

This process has been split into different parts which are described in their
own documents.

## 1. [Preparation]

The steps in this subprocess should be processed early in the release
process, definitely before acceptance testing starts, but also before
development has been completed.


## 2. [Test planning]

This phase should be performed after the end of development but before
acceptance testing starts.


## 3. [Create test distributions]

The purpose of this part is to create the test distributions that can be
used in QA testing for a release. It can also be used to create test
distributions to verify a pull request.


## 4. [Release]

The steps in this part executes the actual release. They assume that
development, the preparation steps and the QA testing have been concluded.
