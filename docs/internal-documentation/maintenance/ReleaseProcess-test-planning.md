Release process - Test Planning
===============================

The purpose of test planning is to raise the quality by making the release
testing more structured, getting better coverage and finding more bugs.
This gives us greater faith in our releases.

## Release testing start up-meeting

1. Compile a list of all pull requests that should be tested.

2. For each test item, discuss how it could and should be tested.
   Make sure there is a heading titled "How to test this PR" in the pull request
   description.
   Add/update notes under this heading to reflect the conclusions made.

3. Discuss prioritization of the test items and who should test what.
   Note down all the conclusions.
