## Background

This is the collection of **Test Case** specifications for the Zonemaster
project. All the details are in the [Master Test Plan].

1. The test cases that has been elaborated as Test Case specifications 
   have been defined as a list of [test requirements]. Each test falls
   under a specific category.
2. The document hierarchy of the Test Case specifications could be found in
   the [Master Test Plan].

## Mapping the Test Requirements to Test Case

1. Each test level has been separated into a separate directory below
   this directory.
2. Under each test level directory there is a level document (README.md)
   describing the test level. Links are found below.
3. The Test Cases are listed below. The mapping from Test Requirement
   to Test Case is found in the [Test requirements] document.

## Elaboration of the test case

1. Test cases are written for almost all Test Requirement. There could
   be the case that a requirement can be implemented by doing more test
   cases than one, or that several requirements are solved by only one
   test case.

## Document Hierarchy

1. Each Test Level described in [Master Test Plan] should be linked
   directly to the correct level document (the README.md in the test
   level directory). The level documents are found here:
   * [Address-TP]
   * [Basic-TP]
   * [Connectivity-TP]
   * [Consistency-TP]
   * [DNSSEC-TP]
   * [Delegation-TP]
   * [Nameserver-TP]
   * [Syntax-TP]
   * [Zone-TP]
